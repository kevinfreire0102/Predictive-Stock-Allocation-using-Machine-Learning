# ML-Based Portfolio Builder: Predictive Allocation

## 1. Research Question
**"Which machine learning model performs best for predicting 5-day stock returns and building an optimal portfolio: Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM?"**

## 2. Setup & Installation

### Clone the repository
Start by cloning the project to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/kevinfreire0102/Predictive-Stock-Allocation-using-Machine-Learning.git
    cd Predictive-Stock-Allocation-using-Machine-Learning

### Create environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install local source package
This installs the project in editable mode, which is required for internal imports to work correctly.

    pip install -e .

## 3. Usage

Run the main pipeline to download data, train models, and generate results:

    python main.py

**Expected output:** Sharpe Ratio and Cumulative Return comparison between three ML models and a Markowitz baseline.

## 4. Project Structure
The project follows a modular data science structure:

## 5. Results & Findings

I compared four approaches over a 10-year rolling window (2015-2024), focusing on the **Sharpe Ratio** (risk-adjusted return) and **Cumulative Return**.

* **Random Forest** was the absolute best performer, achieving a Sharpe Ratio of **2.294** and generating a massive cumulative return of **3844%**. It demonstrated exceptional robustness in various market conditions.
* **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** also significantly outperformed the baseline, with Sharpe Ratios above 2.0, proving that gradient boosting methods are effective at capturing non-linear market patterns.
* **Markowitz (Baseline)** provided a respectable return (345%) but failed to match the predictive power of machine learning models during volatile periods.

**Key Takeaway:** Contrary to traditional financial theory which relies on Mean-Variance optimization (Markowitz), ensemble Machine Learning models—specifically Random Forest—proved capable of identifying complex signals in technical and macroeconomic data, delivering 10x the returns of the standard approach.

### Summary Table
* **Random Forest:** 2.294 Sharpe Ratio (Winner)
* **LightGBM:** 2.139 Sharpe Ratio
* **XGBoost:** 2.077 Sharpe Ratio
* **Markowitz (Baseline):** 1.927 Sharpe Ratio
